<div class="dilevery_box">
    <strong><?= $block->getViewModel()->getMessage() ?></strong>
</div>

<!--
    Why are we fetching getMessage from the ViewModel directory when we can do this from Block ddirectory?
    ans-> this is because by convention we keep all the logic in ViewModel and give abstract access of ViewModel's
    methods to Blocks.
